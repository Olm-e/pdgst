00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
<i>In other news...</i>

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
gave it to me said...

5
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
you can hit

6
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
as far as three kiIometers.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How much are you asking

8
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
for aII of this?

9
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
One thousand dirhams.

10
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
One thousand dirhams?

11
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'II give you five hundred.

12
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And a goat.

13
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000

14
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000

Here, Iet one of your boys try.

16
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let Yussef shoot.

17
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Dad, I want to shoot first.

18
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is the safety.

19
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Push it in when you're ready.

20
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If he doesn't hit the jackaIs,

21
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
at Ieast he'II scare the shit out of them.

22
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Your turn Yussef.

23
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He shoots better than you.

24
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Good Iuck,

25
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
have a good day.

26
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
God bIess you.

27
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
KiII at Ieast three jackaIs.

28
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Make sure no one

29
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
sees you with the rifIe...

30
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
if you see someone coming, hide it.

31
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
What are you doing?

32
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I toId you,

33
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
don't spy on her.

34
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What do you care?

35
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Move it.

36
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Five to two.

37
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There's a jackaI.

38
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Where?

39
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Over there.

40
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What are you doing,

41
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
you idiot?

42
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Zohra doesn't mind.

43
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
She doesn't, but I do.

44
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This is between her and me.

45
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You're both pigs.

46
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Next time I'm going to teII Dad.

47
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Stay out of this.

48
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
If you want me to stay out of it,

49
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
don't do it.

50
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What are you doing?

51
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Hassan said this buIIet

52
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
couId reach three kiIometers.

53
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
That rock didn't move.

54
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You don't know how to shoot.

55
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Give me the rifIe.

56
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
See.

57
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, but that's not

58
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
three kiIometers.

59
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I bet the buIIet

60
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
can't hit that far.

61
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
These buIIets are Iame.

62
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're not aiming right.

63
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
What'II you give me

64
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
if I hit that car?

65
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'II shoot.

66
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You see? Nothing.

67
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Let me shoot.

68
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Shoot at it.

69
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
See... nothing.

70
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You're right, they're useIess.

71
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Where are these kids?

72
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Where are you?

73
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm coming to get you...

74
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You win.

75
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Did you brush your teeth?

76
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
SIeep with angeIs, my darIing.

77
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
SIeep weII, sweetie.

78
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You are aIready sharing a room...

79
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
didn't we agree

80
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to sIeep with the Iights off?

81
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There's nothing to be scared of.

82
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No, that won't happen to you.

83
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How can I be

84
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
in two pIaces at once?

85
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm just asking you

86
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
to take them for today.

87
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't, the mister is stiII home.

88
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
And they aren't going out?

89
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No, I don't think so.

90
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay, I'II taIk to you Iater.

91
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I can't AmeIia.

92
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
PIease, it's my son's wedding.

93
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Just for the day, Lucia.

94
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'II be back for them tonight.

95
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And what do I say to Mrs. Catherine?

96
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't know.

97
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
TeII her they're your nephews.

98
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Right, because they Iook

99
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
so much Iike me...

100
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
with my American Iooking face!

101
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's up?

102
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hi Auntie.

103
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Great to see you, Santiago.

104
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They're reaIIy shy.

105
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
What? These kids

106
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
are coming with us?

107
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I couIdn't find anyone to watch them.

108
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Their parents won't return tonight.

109
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why bring them?

110
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
They'II drive you crazy.

111
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Don't worry,

112
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
they're very good kids.

113
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Don't you want to

114
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ieave them with somebody?

115
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I know a girI who

116
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
can take care of them.

117
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you crazy?

118
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have to take them with me.

119
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I can't Ieave them

120
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
with just anybody.

121
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Are you sure, Auntie?

122
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The baII was out.

123
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
That was out.

124
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No, it was good.

125
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That was out.

126
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm deaf, not bIind.

127
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're out.

128
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You shouIdn't have Iost your temper.

129
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
We Iost the game.

130
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It wasn't my fauIt,

131
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
it was the ref.

132
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you hadn't been thrown out,

133
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
we wouId've won the game.

134
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Why are you

135
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
in a bad mood?

136
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
She's aIways in a bad mood

137
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
because nobody's fucked her yet.

138
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm gonna fuck your dad

139
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
to get rid of my mood.

140
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'II see you at the J-Pop.

141
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What do you want to eat?

142
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I said I'd meet my friends

143
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
from the team at J-Pop.

144
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Didn't you teII me

145
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
we wouId have Iunch together?

146
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Dad, I toId you I was

147
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
going to eat with them.

148
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You never pay attention to me.

149
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My mother aIways

150
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
paid attention to me.

151
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why do you want to fight?

152
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I miss your mother too.

153
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm doing the best I can.

154
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't forget

155
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
the dentist at three.

156
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Take care.

157
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Do you have a tabIe?

158
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Why aII the way in the corner?

159
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Isn't the view nice?

160
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Do you Iike him?

161
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
HeIIo.

162
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
HeIIo.

163
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Can I pIay with you?

164
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Or you can

165
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
have a drink with us?

166
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
TeII him to speak sIowIy.

167
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Can you say that

168
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
a IittIe sIower?

169
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You asshoIes,

170
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
how embarrassing.

171
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What's the matter?

172
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
They Iook at us

173
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Iike we're monsters.

174
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, come off it.

175
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What are you doing?

176
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Now they're going to meet

177
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the reaI hairy monster.

178
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
<i>Don't forget your appointment</i>

179
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
<i>with the dentist. Papa.</i>

180
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I have to go.

181
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'II see you at your pIace, then.

182
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
What are you doing here?

183
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Something we ate

184
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
gave us a stomach ache.

185
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The goats wiII die

186
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
if they don't eat.

187
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Wash your face

188
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
and take them out again.

189
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
My stomach hurts.

190
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
There are other

191
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
chores to do then.

192
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Move it. Let's go.

193
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
God bIess. <b>B</b>ye, bye.

194
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you,

195
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'II see you tomorrow.

196
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
TeII your mother

197
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
to prepare dinner.

198
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Did you kiII any jackaIs?

199
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We shot at them,

200
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
but didn't hit any.

201
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You have to kiII them.

202
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
If not, they're going to eat aII the goats.

203
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why did you come home Iate?

204
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They cIosed the road,

205
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
we took the Iong way.

206
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
ApparentIy some terrorists

207
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
kiIIed an American tourist.

208
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
An American?

209
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes, the terrorists attacked

210
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
a tour bus on the road.

211
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, there aren't any terrorists here.

212
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You never know.

213
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
How do you know

214
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
the American died?

215
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's what they were saying.

216
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The poIice are Iooking for the cuIprits.

217
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes, this is Me<b>x</b>ico.

218
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah... it's fuII of Me<b>x</b>icans.

219
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't taIk Iike that.

220
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's not true.

221
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
How wonderfuI, you made it.

222
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You decided to bring them?

223
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hey, what's up?

224
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, son, Iook how handsome.

225
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You Iook Iike JuIio Preciado.

226
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Forget JuIio Preciado,

227
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
he Iooks Iike Luis MigueI.

228
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
These are the kids

229
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I take care of.

230
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Say hi to Luis.

231
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Lucio, come here.

232
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This is Mike and Debbie.

233
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Take them to pIay.

234
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mom, I don't know how you did it,

235
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
but it zipped up perfectIy.

236
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And it's been 15 years

237
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
since I wore this dress.

238
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You haven't changed a bit, Ma.

239
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Working dear, hard work...

240
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
that's what keeps you young.

241
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What are you guys Iaughing about?

242
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Nothing Ma, nothing.

243
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'II give a buck to the first

244
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
who catches a chicken.

245
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
CarefuI with the 'huevos.'

246
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Very good, Debbie got one.

247
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Debbie's the winner.

248
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, now we need another five.

249
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
So we have five chickens here.

250
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay, now who's going to heIp me?

251
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You? Okay, come.

252
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
HoId it tight, Iike this.

253
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Grab it right.

254
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Everyone back up...

255
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
give me some room.

256
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I need your phone.

257
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I wiII pay.

258
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The buIIet didn't

259
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
touch her spine.

260
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If she stays Iike this,

261
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
she wiII bIeed to death.

262
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Is there anything

263
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
we can do?

264
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I have to stitch up the wound

265
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to stop the bIeeding.

266
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
And teII him

267
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
her cIavicIe is broken.

268
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
We have to

269
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
hoId her down.

270
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Here are the steriIized driII bits.

271
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You have cavities

272
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
in two moIars.

273
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What are you doing?

274
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What's wrong with you?

275
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Get out.

276
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000

Thank you.

280

Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

281
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
She's deaf-mute...

282
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Face her when you speak

283
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
so she can read your Iips.

284
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

285
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000

We just want to taIk to him.

291

Yeah, I'm just going to get my bag.

311
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The cops came again?

312
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah. They hadn't come in nine months.

313
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
<b>B</b>ut these were different cops.

314
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Did they come to ask

315
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
about your mother's death?

316
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
No, but they're probabIy going

to ask my dad about the same things.

318
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They're just not convinced,

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
are they?

320
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000

Idiot.

Did you put on some panties?

324
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you sure

325
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
it was here?

326
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
An American stopped me.

327
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I was scared.

328
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He was covered in bIood.

Where was the bus stopped?

330

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Drop it now.

345
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I toId you to drop

346
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
your weapon.

347
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is just my knife.

348
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Get on the ground.

349
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What did we do?

350
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Get down on the ground...

351
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
face down.

352
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Don't Iook at me.

353
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What did we do?

354
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Take these skins to Najib,

355
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
see if he wants to buy them.

356
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why did you shoot at the bus?

357
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I didn't shoot at anyone.

358
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Then who?

359
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It wasn't me.

360
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That was your rifIe.

361
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I soId it yesterday.

362
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who did you seII it to?

363
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Do you know where

364
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
AbduIIah Adboum Iives?

365
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Yes.

366
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You have to go over those mountains.

367
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Who Iives

368
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
in this area?

369
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We Iive here with our mother.

370
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
AbduIIah Iives on the other side.

371
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
If you're Iying, I'm going to

372
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
come back and cut your baIIs off.

373
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You can come back

374
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
anytime you Iike.

375
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't waIk

376
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
between the graves.

377
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Papa... Papa...

378
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What happened?

379
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The poIice...

380
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
they're Iooking for you.

381
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Me? Why?

382
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
No, not for you...

383
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
they're Iooking for us.

384
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Looking for you?

385
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why?

386
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
<b>B</b>ecause of the tourist.

387
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What tourist?

388
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The American...

389
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Yussef kiIIed her.

390
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Liar, we both did.

391
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What are you saying?

392
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yussef started shooting

393
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
at the cars...

394
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
because Hassan said

395
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
that the buIIet couId go far.

396
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Liar, you started shooting at the cars.

397
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
<b>B</b>ut you kiIIed her.

398
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
What are you saying?

399
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yussef kiIIed the American

400
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and he spies on Zohra naked...

401
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and Zohra Iets him watch her.

402
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That's garbage.

403
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's not garbage.

404
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
She's a street girI and he spies on her.

405
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Time to drink!

406
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This song is dedicated

407
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
from Luis to Patricia...

408
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
the most beautifuI bride

409
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
in the worId.

410
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I think Aunt AmeIia has to dance.

411
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
AmeIia, can I have this dance?

412
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't think your wife

413
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
wouId Iike that.

414
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ohh, she passed away 10 years ago.

415
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Come on AmeIia.

416
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's go dance... You have

417
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
something white on your face.

418
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't get e<b>x</b>cited,

419
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
it's onIy cake.

420

air-conditioning, my husband is iII.

439
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No air-conditioning,

440
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
no gasoIine near. I'm sorry.

441
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
PIease, it's too hot.

442
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
We can get dehydrated.

443
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Who are they?

444
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
My cousins.

445
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Is he deaf-mute

446
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Iike us?

447
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No, but he understands some.

448
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What is your name?

449
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Chieko.

450
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
My name's Haruki.

451
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's whisky.

452
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Do the cops come around here?

453
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sometimes.

454
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You smeII good.

455
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
WeIcome home... may I heIp you?

456
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Are you sure

457
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
you want him to come now?

458
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Is this Detective Mamiya?

459
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The deaf-mute girI you met this

460
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
afternoon asked me to caII.

461
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes, her.

462
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
She says she needs to taIk to you,

463
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
aIone... about her father.

464
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why did you do this?

465
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why did you do this?

466
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Answer me, damn it!

467
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
We were testing the rifIe.

468
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Are you idiots?

469
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You kiIIed a woman.

470
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And you....

471
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You got naked

472
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
so your brother couId watch?

473
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Zohra got naked Iots of times

474
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
so Yussef couId watch her.

475
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Is it true or not?

476
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Is it true or not?

477
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why did you do this to us?

478
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Where's the rifIe?

479
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Where's the rifIe?

480
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I toId you,

481
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
a hunter gave it to me.

482
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What hunter?

483
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
A Japanese hunter...

484
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
gave it to me.

485
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I've got a picture.

486
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
She can get it.

487
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Go get it.

488
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
He's hoIding the rifIe

489
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
he gave me.

490
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We're going to Najib's house.

491
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If the cops come,

492
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
teII them we went south.

493
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This AbduIIah doesn't Iive

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000

495
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you pIaying with us?

496
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000

He Iives there?

499
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're going to take us.

500
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
They're over there.

501
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The poIice, the poIice.

502
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Run... run.

503

Get down.

504
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Mom, stay here tonight.

505
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can't, I have to get these kids home.

506
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000

Take care of my grandchiId.

518
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm dying to be a grandmother.

519
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Take care of my grandchiId.

520
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm dying to be a grandmother.

521
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
SeriousIy, you're not drunk man?

522
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000

529
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hey, be carefuI.

530
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000

531
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000

533
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
San Diego super fast.

534
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't say anything.

535
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Let me do the taIking.

536
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
<b>B</b>ut you're provoking him.

537
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I was just kidding.

538
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What now?

539
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Motherfucker...

540
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What's that?

541
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I heard you... stop shouting.

542
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't shout at me.

543
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Stop shouting at me.

544
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Easy Santiago, pIease.

545
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What are you doing?

546
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What are you doing, Santiago?

547
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
What are you doing!

548
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
See, I toId you!

549
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You shouIdn't have brought them.

550
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Santiago, stop acting Iike a

551
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
madman and stop the car.

552
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
PIease, Santiago, stop!

553
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Shut those kids up!

554
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Shut them up!

555
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
PIease stop, Santiago.

556
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Motherfuckers, fucking gringo asshoIes,

557
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000

558
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Get out. Get out.

559
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Are you crazy? Where?

560
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Get out. If they catch us,

561
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
we're aII screwed...

562
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'II Iose them,

563
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
then come back for you.

564
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Get out, for Christ sake!

565
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Santiago, caIm down.

566
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Aunt AmeIia, get out...

567
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
for the Iove of God!

568
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Santiago is going to

569
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
come back soon and...

570
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
the sun is going to rise.

571
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Why can't you caII

572
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
another ambuIance?

573
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They just toId me

574
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
the ambuIance isn't coming.

575
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And you know we don't

576
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
have another ambuIance.

577
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He wants to know how

578
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
he wiII get his wife out of here.

579
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
TeII him they said

580
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
his embassy wiII deaI with it.

581
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The Americans

582
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
stopped the ambuIance.

583
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
They want to send a heIicopter,

584
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
but there are probIems.

585
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Good evening.

586
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The doorman caIIed to say

587
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
you wanted to taIk to me.

588
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I don't understand.

589
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
CouId you speak sIowIy?

590
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm sorry.

591
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What was it

592
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
you wanted to teII me?

593
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Do you have tea?

594
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
<i>"My father had nothing to do</i>

595
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
<i>with my mother's death."</i>

596
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What's this?

597
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
When your mother jumped off the

598
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
baIcony, your father was asIeep?

599
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You saw her jump?

600
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You've aIready toId the other officers?

601
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What are you taIking about?

602
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Does your father stiII hunt?

603
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There was an incident invoIving a rifIe

604
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
in your father's name.

605
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's why we want to taIk to him.

606
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Understand?

607
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Your father isn't going to jaiI.

608
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We just need to taIk to him.

609
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I have to go.

610
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I reaIIy have to go.

611
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What are you doing?

612
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
What are you doing?

613
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
PIease stop.

614
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No, this is wrong.

615
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're just a girI.

616
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Enough, stop it!

617
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Give me that rifIe.

618
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They're going to kiII us.

619
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They're going to kiII us.

620
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I kiIIed the American. I was the

621
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
onIy one who shot at you.

622
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They did nothing... nothing.

623
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
KiII me, but save my brother, he did

624
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
nothing... nothing.

625
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Save my brother...

626
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
he did nothing.

627
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
They're aIone.

628
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They are chiIdren,

629
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
they wiII die.

630
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
There's no need to apoIogize.

631
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Mr. Wataya, this officer

632
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
has been Iooking for you.

633
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Good evening, I'm Lieutenant Mamiya.

634
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Good evening, how can I heIp you?

635
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Sir, there was an incident and...

636
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

637
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
do you own a .270 caIiber

638
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Winchester M70 rifIe?

639
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Registration number...

640
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
UK-9023.

641
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I don't remember the number,

642
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
but I did have a rifIe Iike that.

643
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Is it true that you gave that rifIe

644
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
to a Mr. Hassan Ibrahim...

645
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
who Iives in Morocco?

646
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Hassan Ibrahim?

647
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He says he was

648
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
your guide in a hunt.

649
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hassan? Yes,

650
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I remember him weII.

651
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He was a good guide and a very

652
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
good man, I gave him the rifIe in thanks.

653
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Did anything happen?

654
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That rifIe was used

655
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
in an attempted murder...

656
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
and the Moroccan poIice want

657
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
to confirm it's not off the bIack market.

658
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No, I gave it to him.

659
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Is Hassan ok?

660
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I don't know about that.

661
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Am I IegaIIy invoIved?

662
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Not for the moment, but can you

663
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
come down to the station tomorrow?

664
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I have a few questions.

665
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Can I Ieave now?

666
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Good night.

667
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
E<b>x</b>cuse me.

668
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I heard from your daughter...

669
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
about your wife on the baIcony.

670
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm very sorry.

671
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What baIcony?

672
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
About how your wife kiIIed herseIf

673
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
by jumping off the baIcony.

674
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
My wife never jumped off a baIcony.

675
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
She shot herseIf in the head.

676
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
My daughter was the first to find her.

677
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I've e<b>x</b>pIained it

678
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
to the poIice many times.

679
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't bother us with that anymore.

680
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm very sorry sir, we won't

681
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
bother you anymore.

682
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Good night.
